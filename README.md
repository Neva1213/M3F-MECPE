This repository contains the official codebase and resources for our paper:

**Emotion across Modalities and Cultures: Multilingual Multimodal Emotion-Cause Analysis with Memory-inspired Framework**

## 📌 Overview

We propose **M³F**, a memory-inspired multilingual multimodal framework designed for Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction (MECPE) across diverse modalities (text, audio, vision) and languages.  
Our model integrates long-range memory modules with cross-modal interaction mechanisms to enhance emotion understanding in rich, real-world dialogue contexts.
